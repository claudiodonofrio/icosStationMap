## Create a World Map with Environmental Measurement Stations

#### You need only to run "stations.py". All information about the stations are downloaded directly from their respective metadata store and combined into one map. Each Network has its own Layer (top right pull down menu in stations.html). By default the map is stored locally to stations.html.

This is how it looks like: [stations.html](https://claudiodonofrio.github.io/stations.html)




The following Networks are implemented sofar:

- ICOS  Integrated Carbon Observation System [https://www.icos-ri.eu] [https://www.icos-.eu]
	- ICOS is the Integrated Carbon Observation System, a European Research Infrastructure. ICOS is the European measurement system for high quality and high precision greenhouse gas observations. The ICOS Carbon Portal provides free and open access to all ICOS data. 

- NEON, The National Ecological Observatory Network [https://www.neonscience.org/]
	- The National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale observation facility operated by Battelle and designed to collect long-term open access ecological data to better understand how U.S. ecosystems are changing. The comprehensive data, spatial extent and remote sensing technology provided by NEON will enable a large and diverse user community to tackle new questions at scales not accessible to previous generations of ecologists.
	
- LTER Network, Long Term Ecological Research [https://lternet.edu/] [https://deims.org/]
	- DEIMS-SDR (Dynamic Ecological Information Management System - Site and dataset registry) is an information management system that allows you to discover long-term ecosystem research sites around the globe, along with the data gathered at those sites and the people and networks associated with them. DEIMS-SDR describes a wide range of sites, providing a wealth of information, including each site’s location, ecosystems, facilities, parameters measured and research themes. It is also possible to access a growing number of datasets and data products associated with the sites. Read more about DEIMS

- AMERIFLUX [https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/]
	- AmeriFlux is a network of PI-managed sites measuring ecosystem CO2, water, and energy fluxes in North, Central and South America. It was established to connect research on field sites representing major climate and ecological biomes, including tundra, grasslands, savanna, crops, and conifer, deciduous, and tropical forests. As a grassroots, investigator-driven network, the AmeriFlux community has tailored instrumentation to suit each unique ecosystem. This “coalition of the willing” is diverse in its interests, use of technologies and collaborative approaches. As a result, the AmeriFlux Network continually pioneers new ground.

- FLUXNET [https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/]
	- FLUXNET is organized through the Regional Networks that contribute data to FLUXNET datasets available at the FLUXNET-Fluxdata webiste (https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/), hosted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (USA).  Here the data that have been shared by the Regional Networks and processed and harmonized to share with the FLUXNET communities.  Fluxdata website offers a number of tools in addition to the data access such communication and ideas sharing platforms, documentation, and support to the FLUXNET data users.
	
- ASIAFLUX [http://asiaflux.net/]
	- AsiaFlux is a regional research network bringing together scientists from universities and institutions in Asia to study the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere across daily to inter-annual time scales.
