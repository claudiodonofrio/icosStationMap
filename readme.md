## Create a World Map with Environmental Measurement Stations

#### You need only to run "stations.py". All information about the stations are downloaded directly from their respective metadata store and combined into one map. Each Network has its own Layer (top right pull down menu in stations.html).
By default the map is stored locally to [stations.html]( http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/claudiodonofrio/icosStationMap/blob/master/stations.html).

The following Networks are implemented sofar:

- ICOS  Integrated Carbon Observation System
	- [https://www.icos-ri.eu] [https://www.icos-.eu]
	- Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) is a pan-European research infrastructure which provides harmonised and high-precision scientific data on carbon cycle and greenhouse gas budget and perturbations.

- NEON, The National Ecological Observatory Network,
	- [https://www.neonscience.org/]
	- The National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale observation facility operated by Battelle and designed to collect long-term open access ecological data to better understand how U.S. ecosystems are changing. The comprehensive data, spatial extent and remote sensing technology provided by NEON will enable a large and diverse user community to tackle new questions at scales not accessible to previous generations of ecologists.
	
- LTER Network, Long Term Ecological Research
	- [https://lternet.edu/]
	- DEIMS-SDR (Dynamic Ecological Information Management System - Site and dataset registry)
	- [https://deims.org/]

- AMERIFLUX
	- AmeriFlux is a network of PI-managed sites measuring ecosystem CO2, water, and energy fluxes in North, Central and South America.
